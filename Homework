Computers in the past Vs Computers in the present

Computer is an electronic programmable machine that accepts data as input through input devices then store and processes it under the influence of a set of instructions called programs to produce the desired output generally known as infornmation. The computers in the past were vastly different from the computers in the present.The computers of the past used vaccum tubes,transistors,integrated circuit as their main component whereas,computers in the present generation use large scale integration and very large scale integration as their main component.The evolution of computers from the past to the present is marked by remarkable advancements in hardware, software, functionality, and accessibility.Below is a comparison highlighting key differences between past and present computers:

a)Size and portability:Early computers, such as the ENIAC(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator) were large and required entire rooms to function due to which there was no room for portability.However, computers in the present such as laptop,tablet and mobile require very less space and have become portable.

b)Power:Early computers had limited processing power. For example, the ENIAC had about 5,000 vacuum tubes and could perform around 5,000 calculations per second.Today's computers are exponentially more powerful, with processors running at speeds measured in GHz (gigahertz) and capable of billions of calculations per second.

c)Consumption:Early computers consued a lot of electricity to run but with each generation computers have becoe more powerful and consume very less electricity.The ENIAC for example, consumed about 150 kilowatts of electricity which was enormous for its time.

d)Cost:Early computers were prohibitively expensive and could cost millions of dollars (e.g., the ENIAC).Today's computers cost's less than a tenth of the price of those from the 1990s. 

e)Reliability:Early computers had a lot of issues and the price to fic those issues were also expensive but the present computers are more reliable and have very less issues and less costly for maintenance.

f)Storage:Early computers used punch cards and magnetic tape for storage, with capacities measured in kilobytes or megabytes.Modern computers have storage options such as solid-state drives (SSDs) and hard drives with capacities measured in terabytes (TB).

Overall,as the generations of computer have evolved the power,reliablilty,storage have increased whereas,the cost,size and electricity consumption have decreased.The current generation of computers are more superior
and powerful in comparision to the computers in the past.Further,with the development of technology and AI(Artificial Intelligence)computers will become more poweful.
